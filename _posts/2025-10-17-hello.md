# Welcome to My First Blog Post

Hello everyone! This is my first blog post. I’ve accepted that I will probably be pretty bad at this, but isn't that the case with anything new we decide to try? Hopefully, if I can stick to posting here for a while I will get better... and you will stick around to read some of my future posts.

## Why make a blog in 2025?

Why not!

I’ve been looking for a new project I can stick to long-term, and this has started to scratch that make‑it / break‑it / improve‑it itch. I've also wanted to start posting more thoughts and opionions but didn't feel right about doing it on the existing social platforms. 

 I will say a number of tech creators on YouTube I follow have started blogs and talked about how much fun it is, so that’s probably where the idea came from for me. 

### The social media ban

Another reason is the impending social media age verification rules here in Australia. While I’m not under 16, the government will require everyone to verify their age to access social media in some way, and I don’t necessarily feel like handing over my ID to Meta, X, or whatever third‑party system we’ll need to submit our data to.

This social media change is only part of it. I also want to force a social media detox on myself. Because admit it, using social media doesn't actually feel good or at least not anymore. Plus, since the release of more and more AI tools i've noticed an uptick in "brain rott" content online. I often find myself scrolling without any enjoyment, feeling my brain shrink. I know it's a dopamine hunt that can't be won and no matter what mechanisms are put in place I will come back to it if it is available. 

### The social media detox

Have you ever closed the Instgram/tiktok app only to catch yourself immediately opening it again? Makes you feel like a gamling addict doesn't it. 

I personally see the internet here in Australia splitting once this policy kicks in. As people are prompted to verify their age, many will reflect on what they’re handing their data over for. Is it worth giving up an ID, browser history, or access to your camera just to watch a few AI reels, see who’s engaged on Facebook, or catch the latest horrors on X? Some will stay on that version of the internet, but I hope more will join me here to build something simpler, more personal, and more open.

Anyways, this is my first post, so hopefully it’s my worst. If you have any feedback, feel free to reach out via the contact buttons on this site.
